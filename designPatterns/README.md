We can use parcel-bundler to help us run TS in the browser
'npm install -g parcel-bundler'

parcel automatically compiles ts files in js

we can run 'parcel index.html' and it will find the referenced ts file and compile/run in in the browser

@types - Definitely Typed Library - has types for libraries that dont have ts support built in
